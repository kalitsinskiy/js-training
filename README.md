## 📊 Evaluation Format

Each block includes:
- **Study materials**: README, examples, exercises
- **Evaluation**: Control questions per topic
- **Requirement**: Must complete previous block before starting next

**Important:** Prepare answers for ALL 10 questions - you won't know which 2 you'll get!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### What You're Learning

**JavaScript** is the language of the web - originally created in 1995 for browsers, it's now one of the most popular programming languages in the world. You'll find JavaScript running:
- 🌐 **In browsers** - Making websites interactive (React, Vue, Angular)
- 🖥️ **On servers** - Building APIs and backend systems (Node.js, Express)
- 📱 **In mobile apps** - React Native, Ionic
- 🖨️ **In desktop apps** - Electron (VS Code, Slack, Discord)
- 🤖 **In IoT devices** - Embedded systems, robotics

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It lets you run JavaScript outside the browser - on servers, in build tools, anywhere! Released in 2009, Node.js transformed JavaScript from a browser-only language into a full-stack powerhouse.

**TypeScript** adds static typing to JavaScript, catching errors before your code runs. Created by Microsoft in 2012, it's become the industry standard for large-scale applications.

**Why this stack?**
- ✅ One language for frontend and backend
- ✅ Huge ecosystem (npm has 2+ million packages)
- ✅ Modern, actively developed
- ✅ High demand in job market

### Prerequisites

**You'll need Node.js and npm installed.**

**Recommended setup with nvm:**

```bash
# Install nvm (Node Version Manager)
# macOS/Linux:
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Windows: Download from https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases

# After installation, restart terminal and run:
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
nvm alias default 22  # Set as default version
node -v  # Should show v22.x.x
```

**Why nvm?**
- 🔄 Switch between Node.js versions easily
- 🎯 Use latest stable version (Node.js 22 LTS)
- 🚀 Avoid permission issues

**Alternative:** Download Node.js directly from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) - get version 22.x LTS

**New to these tools?** → **[Development Tools Guide](docs/TOOLS.md)** explains Node.js, npm, npx, nvm in detail

### Setup (2 minutes)

**1. Install dependencies if you not done that before**
```bash
npm install
```

**2. Create your student branch:**
Create your own branch to keep your work separate and safe.

```bash
git checkout -b student/<your-name>
```

✅ **You're ready to start learning!**

## 📚 Your Learning Workflow

This is your step-by-step process for each block topic:

### Step 1: Read the Theory

Navigate to a topic and read its README:

```bash
cd src/1-javascript/01-variables
cat README.md
```

Each README contains:
- Quick overview of concepts
- Key topics explained
- Links to external resources (MDN, JavaScript.info)

### Step 2: Study the Examples

Run working examples to see concepts in action:

```bash
node examples/let-const.js
node examples/scope.js
node examples/var-hoisting.js
```

Examples show real code with output - experiment with them!

**Need help running scripts?** → **[Running Scripts Guide](docs/RUNNING_SCRIPTS.md)**

### Step 3: Complete the Exercises

Open exercise files in your editor and write code:

```bash
code exercises/variables.js
```

Exercises have TODOs for you to complete. Run them to test your solutions.

### Step 4: Prepare for Evaluation

Read the `QUESTIONS.md` file:

```bash
cat QUESTIONS.md
```

- Study ALL 10 questions
- Prepare answers with code examples
- You'll get 2 random questions during evaluation

### Step 5: Commit Your Progress

Save your completed work:

```bash
cd ../../..  # Back to project root
git add .
git commit -m "Completed block 1: Variables"
```

### Step 6: Move to Next Block

**Important:** Complete the current block's evaluation before starting the next topic. Topics build on each other!

## 🛠 Quick Command Reference

**Running Examples:**
```bash
node src/1-javascript/01-variables/examples/let-const.js
node src/1-javascript/03-control-flow/examples/conditionals.js
```

**Code Quality:**
```bash
npm run lint                # Check code style
npm run lint:fix            # Auto-fix issues
npm run type-check          # TypeScript validation
```
