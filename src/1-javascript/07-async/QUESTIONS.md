- Students: 5 candidates
- Each student gets: 2 questions randomly
- Prepare answers for ALL 10 questions!

**Q1:** What is asynchronous programming? Why is it important in JavaScript?

**Q2:** Explain the three approaches to handling asynchronous code: callbacks, promises, and async/await. What are the advantages of each?

**Q3:** What is "callback hell"? How do promises solve this problem?
