## Questions

**Q1:** Explain the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`. When would you use each?

**Q2:** What is hoisting? How does it work differently with `var` vs `let`/`const`?

**Q3:** What is block scope? Provide a code example showing the difference between block scope and function scope.

**Q4:** Why doesn't `const` make objects immutable? Show an example of what you can and cannot do with a `const` object.

**Q5:** What is the "temporal dead zone"? Why does it exist?

**Q6:** Can you redeclare a variable with `let` or `const`? What about `var`? Show examples.

**Q7:** What happens if you try to access a variable before declaring it with `var` vs `let`? Explain the difference.

**Q8:** Explain variable shadowing. Provide a code example showing inner and outer scope variables with the same name.

**Q9:** When should you use `let` instead of `const`? Give practical examples where reassignment is necessary.

**Q10:** What are the problems with using `var` in loops? Show an example of the classic closure problem with `var` and how `let` solves it.
