# Week 12: JSON & Modules - Evaluation Questions

**Evaluation Format:**
- Total questions: 10
- Students: 5 candidates
- Each student gets: 2 questions randomly
- Prepare answers for ALL 10 questions!

---

**Q1:** What is JSON? What data types can it contain? What types are NOT allowed?

**Q2:** What is the difference between `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`? When would you use each?

**Q3:** What happens when you `JSON.stringify()` an object that contains a function or `undefined`? Demonstrate.

**Q4:** How do you use the second argument of `JSON.stringify()`? Show examples of using a replacer array and a replacer function.

**Q5:** What is a "reviver" in `JSON.parse()`? Give a practical example (e.g., converting date strings to Date objects).

**Q6:** What is the difference between named exports and default exports in ESM? When would you use each?

**Q7:** How does ESM (`import/export`) differ from CommonJS (`require/module.exports`)? What are the trade-offs?

**Q8:** What is a "barrel file" (index.js re-export pattern)? Why is it useful?

**Q9:** How do you enable ESM in Node.js? What are the two ways to do it?

**Q10:** What does "static" vs "dynamic" module loading mean? What's the benefit of static imports for bundlers?
