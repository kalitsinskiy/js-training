# Week 3: Control Flow - Evaluation Questions

**Evaluation Format:**
- Total questions: 10
- Students: 5 candidates
- Each student gets: 2 questions randomly
- Prepare answers for ALL 10 questions!

---

**Q1:** Explain the difference between `if/else` and the ternary operator. When should you use each?

**Q2:** What is the `switch` statement? How does it differ from multiple `if/else if` statements? What is "fall-through"?

**Q3:** Compare `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops. Give an example of when you'd use each.

**Q4:** What's the difference between `for...of` and `for...in`? When should you use each?

**Q5:** Explain `break` and `continue` statements. How do they differ?

**Q6:** What is truthy and falsy in conditionals? Give examples of common pitfalls.

**Q7:** How do you exit nested loops? Explain labeled statements.

**Q8:** What happens if you forget `break` in a `switch` statement? Is this ever useful?

**Q9:** What is short-circuit evaluation? How do `&&` and `||` work with non-boolean values? Give examples of using `&&` for conditional execution and `||` for default values.

**Q10:** What is the nullish coalescing operator (`??`)? How does it differ from `||`? When should you use `??` instead of `||`? What is optional chaining (`?.`)?
