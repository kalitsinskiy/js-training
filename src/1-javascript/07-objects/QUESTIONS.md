# Week 5: Objects - Evaluation Questions

**Evaluation Format:**
- Total questions: 10
- Students: 5 candidates
- Each student gets: 2 questions randomly
- Prepare answers for ALL 10 questions!

**Q1:** What's the difference between dot notation and bracket notation for accessing object properties? When must you use bracket notation?

**Q2:** Explain object destructuring. How do you rename properties and set default values during destructuring?

**Q3:** What is the `this` keyword in object methods? How does it behave differently in arrow functions vs regular functions?

**Q4:** Compare these three ways to copy an object: spread operator, `Object.assign()`, and `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())`. What are the differences?

**Q5:** Explain `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()`. Give an example use case for each.

**Q6:** What's the difference between `Object.freeze()` and `Object.seal()`? Provide examples.

**Q7:** How do you check if a property exists in an object? Compare `in` operator, `hasOwnProperty()`, and checking for `undefined`.

**Q8:** What is computed property names in object literals? Give an example of when you'd use it.

**Q9:** Explain shallow copy vs deep copy for objects. What problems can arise with shallow copying nested objects?

**Q10:** How do you merge multiple objects? Compare spread operator and `Object.assign()`. What happens with duplicate keys?
