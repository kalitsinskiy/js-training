**Q1:** What is a class in JavaScript? How does it differ from a factory function?

**Q2:** What does the `constructor()` method do? What happens if you don't define one?

**Q3:** Explain `extends` and `super`. Why must `super()` be called before `this` in a child class?

**Q10:** When should you use a class vs a plain object vs a factory function? Compare the three approaches.
