# Week 4: Arrays - Evaluation Questions

**Evaluation Format:**
- Total questions: 10
- Students: 5 candidates
- Each student gets: 2 questions randomly
- Prepare answers for ALL 10 questions!

**Q1:** What's the difference between `push()`/`pop()` and `shift()`/`unshift()`? Which operations are faster and why?

**Q2:** Explain `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`. How do they differ? Give an example of each.

**Q3:** What's the difference between `forEach()` and `map()`? When should you use each?

**Q4:** Explain array destructuring with examples. What is the rest operator (`...`) in destructuring?

**Q5:** What's the difference between mutating and non-mutating array methods? Give examples of each.

**Q6:** How does `reduce()` work? Explain with an example beyond simple summation.

**Q7:** Compare `find()`, `filter()`, `some()`, and `every()`. When would you use each?

**Q8:** What happens when you use `map()` but don't return anything? How is this different from `forEach()`?

**Q9:** Explain method chaining with arrays. What's important to remember about the order of operations?

**Q10:** How do you create a copy of an array? What's the difference between shallow and deep copy?
