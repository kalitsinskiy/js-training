# Algorithms & Data Structures — Evaluation Questions

**Evaluation Format:**
- Total questions: 10
- Students: 5 candidates
- Each student gets: 2 questions randomly
- Prepare answers for ALL 10 questions!

---

**Q1:** What is Big O notation? What is the difference between O(n) and O(n²)? Give a code example of each.

**Q2:** Why does bubble sort have O(n²) complexity? When is it acceptable to use it?

**Q3:** Explain merge sort. Why is it O(n log n)? What is the trade-off compared to quick sort?

**Q4:** What is the difference between a Stack and a Queue? Name a real-world use case for each.

**Q5:** How does binary search work? What is the prerequisite and why does it give O(log n)?

**Q6:** Implement a function to find duplicates in an array using O(n) time. Why is a hash map the right tool here?

**Q7:** What is a linked list? What are its advantages and disadvantages compared to an array?

**Q8:** What is the difference between depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS)? When would you choose each?

**Q9:** Explain what "space complexity" means. Give an example of an algorithm with O(1) space vs O(n) space.

**Q10:** What is recursion? What is the base case and why is it critical? Implement factorial recursively and iteratively.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Clear explanation without looking at code
- Can write pseudocode or JS implementation on demand
- Understands why, not just how
- Knows trade-offs (time vs space, best vs worst case)
